##Jackson Clawson's Tufts Comp 20 Private Repo
####Spring 2015

This repository is a portfolio of the work I did for Comp 20 - Web Programming. gh-pages is set up in this repo and works for all of the assignments except the location-server, which is meant to be ran through Heroku. "mmap2" is a copy of "mmap", except the login name is different. So two people can log their locations on the server using the two sites and they will each have unique logins.


My favorite assignment was <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-jclawson/mmap/">mmap</a> because I was able to implement the Google Maps API, get the location of the computer being used, get much more comfortable with Javascript, and manipulate data returned from the backend.


I have grown signficantly since day 1 of this course. I have a much better understanding of the process and tools needed to build a website.


Before taking this course I had taken a couple online courses from <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and messed around with creating some basic pages locally, but my biggest stumbling block was understanding just how many pieces are involved in creating a website and how they all work together. I think that is something that is much easier to learn in a classroom, and I have a much better understanding of it as a result of this class. In this course, I also gained very valuable experience coding in a group, and the tools that are commonly used to facilitate that (GitHub, Dropbox).


After being exposed to various topics and areas of expertise in this course, I would like to delve deeper into client side interface design. I've been very interested in UI/UX for a while and have had experience designing aesthetically, but this is my first primer in how designs are actually developed. My goal is to be proficient enough to become a respected client-side developer with a sharp eye for design.
